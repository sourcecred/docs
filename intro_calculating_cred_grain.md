# An introduction to calculating cred and grain

I’m starting from the assumption that you have some familiarity with the
SourceCred project. If you don’t, then I’d suggest you check out Dandelion's
[20 minute talk (+Qs) from SustainWeb3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVTqRLekRl4)
and some of the other documents in this repo.

Overall, I’m going to throw around a little math, but you should be able to get
solid intuition on this if you’re comfortable talking about a
[graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory) as a set of nodes and edges,
where the edges connect nodes, can be directed, and can have weights. I’ll also
explain [the PageRank algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), which
computes “importance” of nodes in a graph based on the “importance” of nodes
connected to it, and I’ll motivate the intuition behind it as well when I cover
it, but if you like having a strong formal background, Brilliant.com’s
explanation of
[Markov Chains](https://brilliant.org/wiki/markov-chains/#transition-matrices),
[Stationary Distributions](https://brilliant.org/wiki/stationary-distributions/)
and [their quiz](https://brilliant.org/practice/basic-markov-chains) are more
than sufficient. If you just want to get to the explanation, I'll also define
terms as they come up.

## The high level overview

SourceCred takes information about contributions and generates what we call a
contribution graph, and this post will first explain what that graph is and
where it comes from. We then discuss how, from this contribution graph,
SourceCred runs the CredRank algorithm to generate cred scores. This graph of
cred is then used to distribute grain. The grain can then be kept or traded, and
soon will be able to be used to influence the contribution graph in the future.
This overall process is diagrammed in the figure below.

The rest of this document first outlines how collaboration data is gathered and
structured before going into how the exact amounts of cred and grain are
calculated, and ends with some future directions SourceCred as a project is
considering.

## Components of contributing in SourceCred

SourceCred first generates a contribution graph from the input data. In this
graph, a node is a contributor or contribution, and edges represent some sort of
connection between the nodes. These connections are intended to include all
possible ways that a contribution or contributor on a platform can express
dependencies, thanks, or flows of value. Examples would include anything from a
mention on a forum post to liking or merging a PR on GitHub.

It's worth pausing for a moment to make a distinction. In graph theory, a
**weighted graph** has weights on the edges, whereas, the SourceCred
**contribution graph** has weights on both edges and nodes and a few other
features. I'll probably manage not to talk about weighted graphs unless I'm
talking about an example from graph theory.

#### Nodes:

Contributions are represented as nodes in the graph, and are given addresses to
identify them uniquely. These addresses include a prefix, which takes the form:
`[organization making the plugin that generates the node] + [name of the plugin] + [type of contribution]`
(e.g. topic/post/user/like).

Contributors are also represented as nodes in the graph. These nodes are
similarly prefixed, and connected to contributions with directed edges, as
illustrated in the figure below. For example, if an author node creates an
issue, the author node gets an incoming edge from the issue node. Or if an
author of a Discourse post mentions another contributor in the post, the post
creates an outbound edge coming from the author.

Lastly, initiatives are another type of node that serve as a high level place to
connect relevant nodes and discuss governance. It's similar to a tracking issue,
but generalized across the contribution graph, providing a way to organize
planned work for a well-scoped task.

#### Weights:

Both nodes and edges have weights, and an edge object in the SourceCred
implementation can have forward and backwards weight. We’ll get into what these
weights mean shortly, but for now, it’s worth noting that these weights can
easily be set by address prefix. Setting by prefix is implemented as a
multiplicative update; for example, setting issue comments to be worth twice an
issue emoji reaction creates a 2:1 ratio that is preserved by decreasing
GitHub’s edge weights by a factor of 2 relative to those of Discourse.
Additionally, an edge can start and end on the same node (loops), which could be
relevant when a piece of content is edited, or an contribution references
itself.

#### Timestamps:

Additionally, because edges are associated with actions or events, they will
always have a timestamp that corresponds to when the action or event occurred.
Nodes don't need a timestamp, since the edge will carry information about the
moment of the contribution.

#### Summary up to this point:

Now that we know about components of the contribution graph, their properties,
and how they fit together, let’s cover how they’re generated.

## Generating the contribution graph

#### Plugins:

SourceCred uses APIs of collaboration platforms to gather information about
contributions. Currently there are plugins for GitHub and Discourse
([code](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/tree/main/src/plugins)), and
we’re enthusiastic to have more plugins, so we can account for contributions in
different venues. This includes Discord (in progress), and could extend to
Twitter, Reddit, or citations on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) or
[eprint](https://eprint.iacr.org/).

#### Weight parameters:

Because these plugins incorporate data from all sorts of contributions and
output a single directed graph with weights (for nodes and edges), there needs
to be a way to quantitatively compare actions (e.g. authoring a GitHub issue vs
responding or referencing it). To accomplish this, there’s a set of constants
that determine weights for nodes and edges. For an example set of constants, see
the below figure, captured from
[sourcecred.io/cred/timeline/@sourcecred/](https://sourcecred.io/cred/timeline/@sourcecred/)
(follow the link and click the “Show weight configuration” button).

<img src="./images/SourceCred_weights_sliders.png">

> Figure 3. A set of weight sliders to set parameters controlling the relative
> weights of different contributions.

Additionally, parameters, cred, and grain are all scoped to a community. This
means that the community that supports a project sets and controls the
parameters. For that matter, it’s worth reiterating that (lowercase) cred and
grain generated for a project are specific to that project. SourceCred is about
providing community control, keeping humans in the loop, both for gaming
mitigation and general adaptability. At the bottom line, it’s important to keep
the humans in control, because good governance technology only works with the
consent of the governed.

#### Manual input:

It’s also worth noting that not all contributions occur on platforms with
automated data fetching, and thus the capability exists to individually add them
to the contribution graph directly at this stage. It’s clear that there will
always be data that has to be incorporated manually, and how to incorporate
those contributions, especially those not easily quantified, remains an active
area of discussion.

#### Merging graphs:

A plugin will use the API for the collaborative workspace app or platform to
generate a graph of nodes and edges. One interesting caveat is that there isn't
necessarily one most-intuitively correct way to merge two contribution graphs if
they share either edges or nodes (i.e. how would we calculate the combined
weight). Currently, a combined contribution graph is generated from the union of
the nodes and edges from each plugin's contribution graph, with only each
contributor's identities across platforms collapsed into one single identity. If
the nodes and edges of the contribution graph are found not to be disjoint, an
error is thrown; however it's expected that any given contribution or connection
will only be captured on one platform.

#### Summary up to this point:

So at this point, we’ve got data from all our sources combined in one directed
graph, where contributions and contributors are nodes, interactions and
connections between nodes are edges; both nodes and edges have a relative weight
based on parameters the community has set, and we’re ready to run CredRank on
it.

## SourceCred’s CredRank algorithm - motivation

The goal of CredRank is to calculate the relative importance of nodes based on
our contribution graph, specifically the weights of the nodes and edges. We'll
also cover some intermediate calculations shown in the figure below, which
illustrates an expanded overview of SourceCred. In particular, it includes
adding some nodes for cred calculation and converting weights in our
contribution graph to probabilities to eventually run PageRank; a
[Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) is a set of states
with probabilities describing the likelihood of transitioning between states.

Before going into those details, let's motivate the role of probabilities in
calculating cred.

#### Contribution importance as a stationary distribution

Starting from our contribution graph, we want to calculate cred, the relative
importance of nodes. We start with the intuition that any contribution's
importance is explicitly validated by future contributions, and the strength of
that validation is greater if it comes from contributions that are, in turn,
more significant.

As a metaphor, we can visualize cred flowing through the graph as water flowing
through a watershed ecosystem of creeks, springs, and ponds:

- Water bubbles up at certain locations where there are springs feeding ponds.
  These correspond to actions that mint cred.
- Water flows through streams connecting ponds. The flow to downstream nodes is
  proportional to the strength of the connection.
- Additionally, water from all of these ponds seeps into the ground,
  replenishing the springs and providing a closed loop.
- Finally, the equilibrium water level in each pond is proportional the relative
  importance of that node.

The contribution graph tells us the size of various creek beds, but we want to
know the distribution of destinations for the water that leaves each pond. We
can equate the paths a different water droplet can take to the transition
probabilities in a Markov chain. With these numbers, we can calculate
equilibrium distribution of water, called the stationary distribution on a
Markov chain.

We'll cover how we run this calculation after a brief digression on where cred
comes from and a motivation for time-based cred.

#### On the origin of cred

The weights of the nodes are used to determine the amount of cred minted for
each action (i.e. rate at which each spring adds water). This newly-minted cred
flows to connected nodes, but the total amount of cred minted by contributions
will be the total amount received by contributors. In this way, the total amount
of cred increases in proportion to amount of cred-generating activity on the
project itself.

#### Cred-minting philosophy

As a matter of design philosophy, we believe cred should be minted at moments
where there is review of an action, rather than the action itself. This reduces
the danger of spam and reinforces the idea that contributors dictate what is
valuable. For other projects adopting SourceCred, contributions that mint cred
could also be actions performed by a moderator or maintainer.

#### Motivating time-based cred

We believe that contributions should be valued based on their current impact,
regardless of when the contribution was made. As a result, a past action that
was recently found to be valuable in the present should cause new cred to flow
to that action, while a buggy feature that was replaced for being not easily
maintained can cause their cred decrease after the substitution has been made.

In order to accommodate these properties over time, we have adopted a model that
creates "epoch nodes" that, in effect, act like time-bounded identities for each
contributor for each time period. The evolution of a user's cred over time can
then be quickly evaluated by summing over epoch nodes without having to
recalculate a stationary state.

## SourceCred’s CredRank algorithm - calculation

Let's now describe this process in the concrete steps.

#### The seed node

First we add our flow from every node to replenish the groundwater. We create a
"seed node" to which all nodes transfer cred at rate α. Note that, other than α,
the contribution graph only has weights at this point. At the end of the next
step, we'll convert all the weights to probabilities as well. Because the
groundwater supplies the springs, we create edges from the seed node to the
various nodes in the contribution graph, where the weight of the new edge is the
weight of the node.

#### Time epochs and fibration

Then we add epoch nodes to facilitate our calculation of cred over time.

To simplify the computational overhead and storage required to compute cred over
time, SourceCred is moving toward a fibration model where a node is added per
contributor, per unit time (currently weekly for SourceCred). In this model,
epoch nodes intermediate flows to a user from any nodes during a period of time,
and have a fixed transition probability to the user’s node, β (note that, like
α, this is also a probability, not a weight).

A given user's epoch nodes are connected to each other with transition rates
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\gamma_{forward}">
and
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\gamma_{backward}">,
connecting forward and backward in time, respectively. These sets of edges in
the Markov graph are referred to as "webbing" elsewhere. These transition rates
are shown below in Figure 5.

<img src="./images/SourceCred_fibrations.svg">

The motivation for these contributions is two-fold. Firstly, your cred in the
project should have some inertia over time, stabilized across epochs.
Additionally, if you make a contribution at the beginning of one epoch, it's
likely that some if not most of the work took place in a previous epoch, and
thus some cred should flow between epochs.

#### Finishing conversion to a Markov chain

Each node now has a mix of transition probabilities and edge weights. After
checking that the transition probabilities sum to less than one, the remaining
transition probability is then shared between the outbound edges in proportion
to their weights. For example, a node with outbound transition rate α=0.1 and
outbound edge weights of {1,1,2,4} will have transition probabilities
{0.1125,0.1125,0.225,0.45} along those edges; note that probabilities preserve
relative weights.

At this point we can easily generate a pure Markov process from our modified
contribution graph; all we have left to do is collapse any edges linking the
same two nodes into one edge by summing the probabilities (i.e. two interactions
that both flow cred from one node to another)

#### Solving for the stationary distribution

It should be fairly clear that our goal is to calculate the equilibrium amount
for each of the **n** nodes. We have **n** potential flows to all others nodes,
all known. Since the total flow is conserved (flow in = flow out for each node),
we can write **n** equations with **n** unknowns, which we could solve for the
equilibrium cred.†

#### Stationary distribution as an eigenvector

If you’ve spend time in linear algebra land, you’ll be pleased to hear that
common way to compute this (in algebraic graph theory) is to convert the graph
to a matrix _P_ where each entry
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=P_{uv}"> is the
transition probability from node _u_ to node _v_. Each dimension corresponds to
a node, and the matrix maps from all nodes to all nodes. Then finding the
stationary distribution is the same as finding
[the eigenvector](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g) of the transition
matrix that corresponds to eigenvalue 1; by the definition of an eigenvector,
this vector is the distribution of value to each node such that if value flowed
down each edge in proportion to its weight, the resulting value distribution
would remain the same.

#### Cred from a stationary distribution:

Once we've computed the stationary distribution, we have a "raw score" assigned
to every node in the graph. These scores form a probability distribution, so
they sum to 1. However, we want cred scores; which means that the "total amount
of cred" should sum to the total amount of cred minting, i.e., the total node
weights.

Therefore, we compute: _m_, the sum of all node weights in the graph, and _s_,
the sum of all raw scores received by "scoring nodes" (typically users). Then,
for any node _n_, its cred score
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=c_n"> is derived
from its raw score
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=r_n"> by:
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=c_n = r_n * m / s">.
This ensures that the sum of all users' cred is equal to the total amount of
cred that was minted. This means that the total amount of cred grows over time,
as the number of contributions that mint cred increases.

We now discuss how grain, SourceCred's "proof-of-support" token, is calculated
from this and distributed.

## Grain dynamics

#### How much grain is generated

Once SourceCred calculates the cred for individual contributors, that cred is
linked to an identity that is an amalgamation of their identities across the
platforms (e.g. GitHub handle or Discord username). A constant amount of
SourceCred grain (¤) is produced per unit time, currently 15000¤ per week. This
amount is distributed according to two different distribution mechanisms.

- 20% of the grain is “fast,” and is disbursed to nodes in proportion to the
  cred earned by each node in the past week. This is intended to provide fast
  feedback.
- 80% of the grain is “slow,” and is disbursed in proportion to the difference
  between total grain you've been distributed, and what that node’s proportional
  fair cred would be over all history. This is intended to ensure that everyone
  is rewarded in proportion to their lifetime contributions.

For example, if your past work was unrecognized until recently, your slow
payment should reflect the recently recognized value of the contribution.
Alternatively, if you joined this week, you’ll only have fast grain. It's also
possible that a change in the algorithm or weights imply a contributor was
over-paid in the past, and thus won't receive any slow payments for a while. The
fast component can potentially over-distribute grain, but it will get diluted by
other contributions.

There are some interesting second-order dynamics here relating the rate of "cred
inflation" vs "grain inflation":

- If grain is minted faster than cred, then the slow payment will pay all
  contributors (even inactive contributors) because the lifetime grain-per-cred
  value is increasing.
- If cred is inflated faster than grain, then the slow payment will only pay
  recipients of "new" cred, i.e. an inactive contributor whose cred stays
  constant would stop receiving slow payments (because they already reached
  target grain-per-cred for their amount of cred).

#### How grain is traded:

Grain payouts are currently tracked by Dandelion in an observable notebook
linked to in
[this Discourse thread](https://discourse.sourcecred.io/t/sourcecred-contributor-payouts/298).
We currently consider grain a "preview" or experimental balance, though we plan
to honor it going forward. As a result, actually receiving grain is an opt-in
process. If you opt in, there may be financial or tax liabilities; if you don't,
it currently seems like grain is just a number in a list. Additionally, grain
distributions will vest over time in order to smooth out the peakiness of grain
distribution, as described in
[this Discourse thread](https://discourse.sourcecred.io/t/grain-vesting/636).
Even now, grain can be sold or given. In fact,
[Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/) supports SourceCred by purchasing grain
directly from contributors. At present, the transfer of grain is executed by
recording changes to the observable notebook on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/sourcecred/cred).

## Future roadmap features

#### Boosting:

The next big feature on
[the SourceCred roadmap](https://discourse.sourcecred.io/t/sourcecred-beta-roadmap/422)
is boosting, outlined in
[this discourse post](https://discourse.sourcecred.io/t/cred-boosting/257). The
expectation is that anyone would be able to spend their grain by permanently
staking it on a node. This action would increase that node’s weight, and adds an
edge in the graph from the node back to the individual who boosted it. Boosting
issues, PRs, or initiatives has the effect of increasing visibility and
importance of those nodes, and can work to speculate on the future importance of
fixing those bugs or adding those features. Boosting users, alternatively, has
the effect of sponsoring someone to work on the project.

#### ERC20 grain:

SourceCred also intends to create grain as an ERC20 token, outlined in
[this discourse post](https://discourse.sourcecred.io/t/an-erc20-to-track-grain/386).
It’s expected that running the cred calculation will be too heavy for a smart
contract, but an oracle could provide the cred values to the chain, allowing
both cred and grain to be accounted for on-chain.

#### Meta-cred and meta-grain:

We also hope that other projects will adopt and use SourceCred, which will
result in the creation of multiple project-specific cred and grain values. We
should be able to create a meta-cred graph, where each node is a project (rather
than a contribution) and edges are dependencies; at this point, meta-cred and
meta-grain allow us to flow value across the complete ecosystem.

#### Decentralized governance:

Using cred or grain for governance is not on the current roadmap, but it’s
pretty intuitive how the system might work, with weights being set by a DAO.
Decentralizing the governance is definitely part of the plan, but the project
isn’t quite ready for it yet.

Additionally, it’s worth looking at github for
[the current project status](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/blob/main/README.md).

† It's worth noting that a Markov process is guaranteed a stationary
distribution only if the process is ergodic and irreducible. Other than stating
that our seed node makes our Markov process satisfy these, it's not worth
considering at this depth. I would encourage a curious reader to continue their
exploration of ergodicity on
[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodicity#Markov_chains),
[Brilliant](https://brilliant.org/wiki/ergodic-markov-chains/), or your favorite
reference.
