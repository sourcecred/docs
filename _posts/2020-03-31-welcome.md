Welcome to the SourceCred Documentation base! This small feed of news is intended for
announcements, changes, any any other news related to the docs. Now that you are here,
let's give you some resources to be empowered to learn about Jekyll!

<!--more-->

If you want to add an announcement like this one, simply add a file in the `_posts` 
directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` 
and includes the necessary front matter (copy paste it from the example here!). 
Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('SourceCred')
#=> prints 'Hi, SourceCred' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the 
most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. 
If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
