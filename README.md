# SourceCred Documentation

This repository is the source-of-truth for SourceCred's documentation.

The documentation website is based on [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/)
and you can read the [documentation there](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/introduction) for how to use it! Generally:

 - [docusaurus.config.js](docusaurus.config.js) holds configuration and metadata values
 - [pages](pages) is for dynamic ad-hoc React pages
 - [docs](docs) are for documentation content and pages
 - Sidebar items can by added by adding an entry to [sidebars.js](sidebars.js)
 - The top navigation and footer is controlled by the `themeConfig` value in [docusaurus.config.js](docusaurus.config.js)

Once the structure of the site is developed, you shouldn't need to edit these fields too much!
However if you want to add a new page (to [pages](pages) or [docs](docs)) please don't
hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/sourcecred/docs/issues) - we are here to help you!

## Organization

You can browse the markdown files under [docs](docs) from the repository
as is - these are organized by subfolder and the organization should be intuitive.

## Usage

The steps for adding or editing any document means editing a markdown file in
the [docs](docs) folder. You can do this in the GitHub interface directly,
or by cloning to your local machine, discussed next.

### 1. Get the code

You can clone the repository as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sourcecred/docs
cd docs
```

#### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

#### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

#### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.


### 2. Make Changes

At this point you can edit pages in [pages](pages) or [docs](docs) and add new pages
as you see fit. See the [development](#development) section for how to update the table of
contents or navigation, and [open an issue](https://github.com/sourcecred/docs/issues)
if you need some help!

#### Making a New Documentation Page

You can write a markdown file anywhere in [docs](docs) that seems appropriate.
The only difference is that you need to add a header snippet that looks like this:

```yaml
---
title: Page Title
description: Write what this page is about here
---
```

Let's say that we put this in a file called `docs/getting-started.md`. This
would render on the site to `/docs/getting-started` and we could add to our sidebar
as such. How might we do that? In the [sidebars.js](sidebars.js) it might look
like this:

```js
module.exports = {
  sidebar: {
    "ðŸŒŽ Community": [
      'community/intro',
      'community/glossary',
      {
        'ðŸ§  Concepts': ['community/concepts/cred', 'community/concepts/grain', 'community/concepts/champion', 'community/concepts/deep-then-wide', 'community/concepts/bikeshedding'],
      },
      'community/CODE_OF_CONDUCT',
    ],
    "ðŸŒŸ Culture": ["culture/review_culture"],
  },
};
```

The values such as `community/intro` represent the path of the markdown file you want to link to. You can nest categories inside eachother like "Concepts" is nested inside "Community".

#### Making a New Page

If you would like to create ad-hoc pages using React, you can do so by creating a js file in the [pages](pages) directory. This will work like any other React web-app!

You can read more about creating pages in the [Docusaurus docs](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages).


#### Adding to Navigation

To add links to the top Navigation bar or Footer you can dit the [docusaurus.config.js](docusaurus.config.js) file.

```js
module.exports = {
  themeConfig: {
    navbar: {
      title: 'SourceCred',
      logo: {
        alt: 'SourceCred Logo',
        src: 'img/favicon.png',
      },
      links: [
         {
           to: 'docs/community/intro',
           activeBasePath: 'docs',
           label: 'ðŸ“– Docs',
           position: 'left',
         },
         {
           href: 'https://github.com/sourcecred',
           label: 'Github',
           position: 'right',
         },
        // ... other links
      ],
    },
  }
}
```

You can read more about configuring the navigation in the [Docusaurus docs](https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/docusaurus.config.js#themeconfig).


### 4. Open a Pull Request

Once you've made changes on your new branch, open a new pull request to have them
reviewed! When they are merged to master they will go live on the site.


#### A Note On Comments

You can add a comment to a page using the following syntax:

```
[//]: # (THIS IS A COMMENT)
```
