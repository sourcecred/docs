### SourceCred Branch/Job Description: I'm the founder of SourceCred, and currently serve as its Temporary Benevolent Dictator (TBD). I also lead the dev and strategy branches of the project.

### *I'm a genderqueer hacker, a joyful hacker, and a bad philosopher. I've long been fascinated by the intersection of economics, philosophy, and technology, and SourceCred is an attempt to synthesize those perspectives into a tool to build new, more equitable ways of working together. I also love snowboarding and partner dancing.*

### SourceCred Branch/Job Description: Community Cultivation/Social Architect

### *I'm a genderqueer artist and communicator. I got to be around for the conception of SourceCred, and later became a part of the team using my soft skills around interpersonal relationships and community structure. Now, I champion the Community Cultivation branch and work with our community to develop a wholehearted space that can scale with its values.*

### *Traveller, skackliner, boulderer and musician. A bit frisky. I'd love to see a world where SourceCred is widely used, because people would have the freedom to work on what brings them joy.*
