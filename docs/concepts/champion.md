title: 🏅 Champion
description: an individual that takes initiative
---

A champion is an individual that starts an initiative with a determined promise
to finish it. The individual generally takes charge of a well-scoped task, and
provides clear direction and confidence about completing it. By calling someone
a champion, you are placing faith in their ability as a leader and visionary.

### What does this mean for development?

While the term champion may inspire mental imagery of soliders and stallions, in
the development battle field, champions wear much less flashy armor. A champion
might be:

- A team member that proposes a new feature, clearly describes the problem that
  it solves, and then proceeds to get feedback and create a plan for
  implementation. The team member then executes, all the while being clear about
  timeline, goals, and having clear communication.
- An open source contributor who commits to working on a particular component,
  and proceeds to follow through and becomes a primary maintainer of that
  component.
- An individual that provides leadership for an under-represented or
  under-served demographic in the community, and helps to empower that group to
  have a stronger voice.

### When should someone be called a champion?

It may be the case that a contributor doesn't want to be called a champion
directly, so it's suggested to use the term in a verb sense. For example, you
might say:

> This individual has offered to champion this initiative.

which is a different thing than:

> This individual is a champion.

The first suggests taking action, which is empowering and positive. The second
says something about the character of the individual, which could be unwanted if
it places un-needed stress or expectation on the individual.
