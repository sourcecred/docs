description: levels of trust in communities using SourceCred
---

SourceCred's purpose is to empower communities to allocate rewards to
contributors, through Cred and Grain. However, this allocation leads to gaming
opportunities which are not part of the community values. For SourceCred to help
sustain community safety, it must be resilient to such gaming.

The kinds of gaming that will happen depends on the ambient level of trust and
social cohesion within the community. A small community of aligned, like-minded
members might see very little gaming, where the majority will work together to
make sure everyone is fairly credited. Whereas a larger and more anonymous
community may have members who choose to focus on increasing their scores,
rather than the community's mission.

The SourceCred team has developed the concept of "Trust Levels" in an attempt to
determine which communities SourceCred is ready to support, provide a structure
for communities using SourceCred to use if they choose, and consider what kinds
of problems communities might encounter along the way.

- **Trust level 3** (TL3): Collaborative. This is the highest trust level. It is
  taken as [common knowledge][common-knowledge] that everyone in the community
  is acting in good faith. People feel comfortable reflecting on their own
  incentives: ‚ÄúAm I subconsciously skewing the Cred to benefit myself?‚Äù; ‚ÄúHow
  have my motivations changed over time?‚Äù. When asking the same questions of
  others, we trust that the responses are thoughtfully and truthfully given.
  Discussions of accidental or subconscious gaming are treated as precious data
  to be shared and analyzed, never as evidence of any kind of wrongdoing.

  _As an example, imagine a group of friends launching a startup together, with
  a bold vision of improving the world._

- **Trust level 2** (TL2): Wary. The community has a core backbone of
  contributors that are focused on common goals, but some members may be more
  focused on optimizing their own rewards. TL2 is primarily distinguished from
  TL3 by good faith is no longer a uniform assumption. Expect skewed voting
  records, underrecognition of others‚Äô help, and quarrels over attribution or
  allocation.

  _As an example, imagine the startup is now a growing company. The "core group"
  is motivated by the vision, but some of the new hires just see it as a job._

- **Trust level 1** (TL1): Alert. This community controls a scarce resource.
  That resource is considered intrinsically valuable by some people outside the
  community, who are willing to devote their time to acquiring that resource
  without much thought for scruples. TL1 is primarily distinguished from TL2 by
  gaming being the main goal rather than an opportunistic ‚Äúside hustle.‚Äù Expect
  voting cliques, [sybils], chains of obfuscated self-dealing, and attempts to
  corrupt structures of leadership and governance.

  _As an example, imagine that the startup is now a large company. It has hired
  a lot of ex-management-consultants and business school types._

## Caveats

This is only one dimension among several that will influence a community's
experience with SourceCred.

Using SourceCred healthily also requires emotional maturity, conflict resolution
skills, and community leadership.

## Usage

It‚Äôs important to recognize that trust level varies both with time and with
community. As of mid 2020, the SourceCred community is in TL3, but (e.g.) some
communities are surely in TL1.

A given iteration of the SourceCred system will be appropriate for some subset
of trust levels. As of SourceCred 0.5.0, SourceCred has been tested in TL3, is
experimentally available for Tl2, and should not be used in TL1.
