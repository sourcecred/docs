Grain can be viewed and tracked at [http://cred.sourcecred.io/#/explorer](http://cred.sourcecred.io/#/explorer).   

This page shows the amount of cred and grain accrued, and can be sorted by Username or time period (week, month, all-time).  
Ledger history, showing the grain transfers, is also available.
