## What is an Ambassador?

A SourceCred Ambassador is someone who is already connected to the community and is on the Community Cultivation Team. Ambassadors assist you as you explore the intersection between your skills, your interests, and the needs of SourceCred. They'll help you figure out where to get started, and connect you with others in the community who are championing initiatives you're excited to contribute to.

An Ambassador relationship usually spans the first couple of weeks to make sure that you've settled in well, however, they will always be a lifeline for you to reach out to if you're struggling or confused.

## Should I request an Ambassador?

Before requesting an Ambassador, you should have moved through the first few steps of engaging with our community outlined in the [How to Get Involved guide](/docs/get-involved). Including:

- Joining the [SourceCred Discord](https://sourcecred.io/discord)
- Reading up on the available documentation
- Introducing yourself on Discord
- Coming to a Community Call

If you haven't taken the time to take those steps, then you may want to give them a try before requesting an Ambassador. However, if you find yourself supremely stuck with any of these tasks, it's okay to request an Ambassador anyway and get help with them.

If you're still not sure whether to request an Ambassador yet, ask yourself: "Am I excited to start contributing?" If you're not quite ready to dig your hands in, then you may not be quite ready to work with an Ambassador, as their main focus will be helping you to truly get started.

## How do I request an Ambassador?

To request an Ambassador, go to the SourceCred Discord and find the "#cultivation" channel. Post in the channel letting the team know that you'd like an Ambassador to help you start contributing to SourceCred. Shortly after, an Ambassador will send you a private Discord message about your interest and help set up a time where you can have a voice call.

### Other reading you may enjoy:

While it's just a draft, and some of the systems outlined are not in practice yet, you may enjoy reading through the [A Better Onboarding](https://discourse.sourcecred.io/t/a-better-onboarding/767) Discourse topic which outlines the process we are designing for newcomers as they walk the path to becoming full fledged contributors.

You can always reach out to the Cultivation Team with questions regarding any newcomer topics. Pop by our Discord and share your questions or thoughts in the #cultivation channel. We'll be happy to have your input. :)
