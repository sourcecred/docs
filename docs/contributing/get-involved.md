# Getting Started With SourceCred

This guide draft outlines the steps any beginner would need to take to dip their toes into the SourceCred Community. Below we‚Äôll discuss both technical ways of getting connected, and the social norms of starting out.

This guide is meant to reflect where our community and infrastructure is at *now* , though we do intend to make these systems more polished and add more features/capabilities as time goes on and more tools are built to enable our community.

# 1. Joining the SourceCred Discord

The very first step for getting involved with our community is to join our community discussions. [Discord](https://discord.com/) is the platform we use to be social and talk not only about our projects and goals, but also to get to know one another and build a sense of connection in real time.

#### Step 1: Create a Discord Account

If you have never used Discord before, you‚Äôll want to download the application (or access it via web browser) and create your own account with their service.

#### Step 2: Join SourceCred‚Äôs Community Discord Server

Discord is a service, and SourceCred has it‚Äôs own server where you can join the conversation. Once you've got your Discord account, you can join the SourceCred server with [this invite](https://sourcecred.io/discord).

# 2. Poke Through Our Resources

Explore this website, the #signpost channel in Discord, and, if you're feeling adventurous, our [Discourse forums](https://discourse.sourcecred.io).

# 3. Introduce Yourself

We want to get to know you! Go to the SourceCred Discord and find the channel #intros. Post there letting us know that you‚Äôre poking into SourceCred and tell us a bit about yourself.

You may want to share things like:

* Your preferred name
* What brought you to SourceCred
* Other projects or activities you‚Äôre passionate about
* Why you may want to work on SourceCred
* Anything else you want to share!

# 4. Come to a Community Call

The SourceCred Community Call is a weekly voice call which we encourage anyone in the community to attend, but especially those folks who are new to SourceCred and want to know more about it.

We encourage you to attend one and see how you like our community. We also would love it if you brought a question or two with you about things you‚Äôd like to understand better within SourceCred. That way, not only do you get a chance to learn but others on the call will have the chance as well!

The Community Call is every Tuesday at 11am PT (double check your time zone) in the ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù voice channel on our Discord.
You can add it to your Google Calendar using [this invite link](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MTVsc3ZiczVpc3AyOWYya2VmYmUxaWhnZXBfMjAyMDA1MTlUMTgwMDAwWiBvcHNAc291cmNlY3JlZC5pbw&tmsrc=ops%40sourcecred.io&scp=ALL).

# 5. Get an Ambassador

Once you‚Äôve decided that you like the SourceCred community, and that you‚Äôd really like to get involved bringing your own unique perspective and skills to the benefit of the project, you‚Äôre ready for an Ambassador. Ambassadors help to guide newcomers on their path to becoming full contributors in the project and will provide you with support and resources on your journey.

If you‚Äôre not quite ready to dig your hands in and start contributing, that‚Äôs okay. Feel free to keep chatting on the Discord, reading the documentation, and coming to the Community Calls. Once you feel like you want to get more involved and start contributing, our Ambassadors will be here for you.

You can find more step by step info for requesting your own Ambassador [here](https://discourse.sourcecred.io/t/how-to-get-an-ambassador/727).
