title: ðŸš² Bikeshedding
description: The concept of bikeshedding refers to focusing on details instead of the bigger picture.
---


Bikeshedding means talking (or even arguing) about a small detail instead of a larger issue at hand. 
If you imagine building a house and having a bike shed outside, it would be akin
to angsting over the color and fun name for the bike shed instead of working on
actually finishing the house. At the end of the day, you won't have a place to live
because you were lost in details that didn't matter.

### In the wild

If you take a look at [sourcecred](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/search?q=bikeshedding&type=Issues), there are several instances of a mention of bikeshedding.
Here is [an example](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/pull/1537#pullrequestreview-340900146) from @decentralion:

> I'm approving this change because it is timely and needed, and because as a rule, we should avoid bikeshedding as a reason to withhold approval.

In the above statement, they recognize that scrutinizing details can delay approving changes, and given the urgency and need of the change, are pointing
out that this should be avoided.
