# Product Circle Bylaws
- Product Circle uses a consent-based decision-making process
    - For now, we plan to be informal/collaborative about facilitation, but we will make explicit calls for consensus when required.
        - At a minimum, each consensus meeting should have 1-2 facilitators and 1 notetaker designated at the beginning of the meeting.
    - Quorum is 50%, with a 48 hour window for asynchronous weigh-ins. Reversible decisions can be implemented before the 48 hour window is over and may need reversed if dissent arises. Difficult-to-reverse decisions should wait for the end of the window before implementation.
    - Meetings must have 24 hours notice to be eligible for official consensus.
    - Anyone can attend and participate in our calls, but only Members count towards circle consensus.
    - Summary of things that require Circle consensus
        - Acceptance into Dating Period
        - Acceptance into Membership
        - Activation and Deactivation of non-member accounts in the instance

    - To join the Product Circle, start with a 4 month dating period
        - The first 2 months of the dating period
            - Goals: 
                - building relationships with the team
                - building up knowledge capital
                - demonstrating competencies that directly further the product circle's aims
                - demonstrating/developing competency in using our product from the Instance Maintainer perspective
            - Mutual Expectations
                - The Candidate will set up a one-off meeting with each of the circle members.
                - The Circle will appoint a Mentor, who will set up a weekly check in with the Candidate. The Mentor can change through informal negotiation.
                - The Circle will prepare as much task curriculum as the Candidate needs. The Mentor will track this and advocate for the Candidate to get the curriculum they need.
                - The Mentor will take responsibility for tracking and advocating for the Candidate's financial needs in this process.
        - The second 2 months of the dating period
            - Goals:
                - demonstrating leadership and the ability to hold power responsibly
                - demonstrating/developing accountability skills as applicable
                - demonstrating reliability and consistency
                - practicing our governance process and other member-specific skills
            - Mutual Expectations:
                - The Circle will create leadership opportunities for the Candidate, e.g. leading a sprint planning session, leading grooming, planning and executing a Hackathon or a social space for the Product Circle.
                - The Candidate will participate in at least half of the circle's governance meetings, but their "vote" will be non-binding.
        - The Circle is responsible for approving someone to enter the Dating Period, to move to the second phase of the Dating Period, and to become a member at the end of the Dating Period.
        - Effectively, there are three statuses for contributors:
            `Casual Contributor` - Someone who is contributing to the Product Circle's aims but is not a member and is not in a dating period. Anyone can be a casual contributor.
            `Dating` - Someone in the dating period, aiming to be a member.
            `Member` - Someone with full participation rights in the consent-based decision making process. `Member` is the only status that contains full voting weight and is semantically considered "inside" the circle.
- Remuneration (compensation)
    - Anyone is eligible to be activated. Members can self-select activation and deactivation at any time. Non-member activation and deactivation must be approved by the circle.
    - Cred-based income is the default.
    - Salary-based income is intended for cases where a stronger sense of stability is needed.
        - Individuals with salaries will not be eligible for grain in the `recent` policy but will be eligible for grain in the `balanced` policy.
        - The expectations of Salaried contributors will be agreed upon case-by-case between the contributor and the Circle.
        - Salaries are determined and approved on a case-by-case basis by the circle.
    - All compensation must be accounted in the instance ledger.
    - Personal Attributions of cred between members does not need circle consensus, only consent between the members.
- Responsibilities of Membership
    - Participate in at least half of the following circle rhythms, and communicate when you will miss them:
        - Governance meetings
        - Annual review of this document
        - Quarterly and monthly peer reviews
    - Direct contribution to the circle's aims.
    - Take responsibility for helping with care work including some of the following:
        - Admin work / Instance maintenance
        - Tech support
        - Mentorship (formal and informal)
        - Code/PR/Design Reviews
        - Facilitation / Notetaking
        - Relationship nurturing / Trust building inside and outside the circle
- Revoking Membership/Salary/Advanced Permissions
    - Members are expected to self-identify when they can't meet the expectations of their role/salary/membership.  The group may revoke or suspend (hiatus) that membership according to that moment.
    - Members are encouraged to give feedback, with consideration for consent, timing, trust.
    - We will have monthly peer review for Salaried roles and quarterly peer review for Membership. We will iterate on the How of these evaluations outside this document.
    - What is our initial response to someone not meet the standard of the evaluations?
        - A buddy from outside the circle (as possible) is selected by the person in question. The person and their buddy submit a proposal for concrete demonstration of missed responsibilities within 2 weeks. This should be prioritized over usual work output during these two weeks. At the end of 2 weeks the Circle meets with the person+buddy to give feedback on the plan, but ultimately the plan is up to the person+buddy.
        - In the next month, the buddy and the person are responsible for documenting examples of the planned concrete demonstrations. If relationships with other teammates are implicated, the other teammates are responsible for actively participating in the repairs.
        - 1 month after the plan is agreed upon, another review will take place.
        - If the responsibilities have been met, the process ends.
        - If not, the Circle minus the person in question will decide what to do. This may include extending the process or revoking/altering membership/salary.
    - Emergency situations involving sabotage or existential threats to our team or product can be mitigated short term by a 30% vote.
- Representing the Will of the Circle
    - Individuals shouldn't represent the will of the circle beyond what the circle has agreed on together. This includes roadmaps, high-leverage designs, and cross-circle/cross-community diplomacy.
    - Some tools to avoid misrepresentation:
        - Check in early and often with the circle when in a position of representation.
        - Move at the speed of trust.
        - Notice and emphasize when you are speaking from personal opinion.
        - Codified straw poll mechanism for rapid sentiment alignment/validation of personal perspectives?
- Bootstrapping AKA Initial Membership
    - The initial members will be in a dual state of member and dating phase. Membership status may change according to the dating phase processes.
    - Ideas for Offers for Initial Membership:
        - Thena
        - Kevin
        - Haz
        - Magwalk
        - Yaz
        - Ryeder
    - One of the first responsibilities of the initial circle is to fold in any dating phase candidates that did not make this list.
