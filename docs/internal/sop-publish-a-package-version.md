* **Important note about package names in a monorepo:**

  * We need to ensure that package names in a monorepo do not compose one another (are not substrings of one another) or else we risk dependabot associating incorrect release notes to upgrades. For example, if we have a package `sourcecred` we **cannot** create a package `sourcecred-plugin`
* **Prerequisites:**

  * Have an [NPM account](https://www.npmjs.com/) with Two-Factor Auth (TFA) enabled and get added to our NPM team
  * This is an alias that adds the contribution command to git `git config --global alias.contributions 'log --grep="[Bb]ump" --invert-grep --pretty=oneline'`
  * Generate a github personal access token and get the prod discord token from @Kevin or @Thena, and put them either in the local env or in a .env file as: SOURCECRED_GITHUB_TOKEN and SOURCECRED_DISCORD_TOKEN
  * ...?
* **Instructions:**

  * open two empty terminal windows
  * in your first terminal window, navigate to the `sourcecred/sourcecred`repository
  * `git stash` stash any changes
  * `git checkout main && git pull --rebase` get the latest changes and rebase your main branch
  * `yarn build`
  * `git log` double-check that you have the changes you want to include in the release
  * Run some tests:

    * in second terminal window navigate to `sourcecred/cred` clone:
    * `git checkout origin/gh-pages && git pull`
    * load your github and discord token
    * `scdev go` run all the things to make sure they are working (note `scdev` is an alias - see [readme](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/tree/master/packages/sourcecred#using-a-modified-backend) )
    * `scdev serve` spin up the UI
    * open a browser and manually test the UI - look for places that might be broken due to new changes and make sure everything is working as expected

      * ideally we hope to have Cypress for frontend testing, in the meantime we need to test manually
    * once you have tested the UI and everything seems solid, you are ready to publish your version release!
  * Publish the thing to GitHub

    * Create the branch and version bump commit:

      * go back to your `sourcecred/sourcecred` terminal window
      * `git checkout -b version-0.8.5` create a branch
      * open the `packages/<package folder name>/package.json` file in your favorite text editor and manually update the number next to `version` to your new version number (`0.8.5` for this example) and then save the updated `package.json`
      * run `git add packages/<package folder name>/package.json` in your terminal window
      * `git commit -m 'Bump <packagename> version to 0.8.5'` commit your changes e.g. `Bump sourcecred version to 0.8.5`
      * `git push origin head -u` push your changes to your new branch 
    * Create the version bump PR:

      * in a browser, navigate to GitHub and make a pull request with your new branch
      * get someone else to review and approve your pull request
      * once your PR has been approved, merge your pull request
    * Make the GitHub Release:

      * go back to your first terminal window (in the `sourcecred/sourcecred` repo)
      * `git checkout main`
      * `git pull --rebase`
      * `git tag packagename-v0.8.5` create a git tag for your version release, e.g. `git tag sourcecred-v0.8.5`

        * for non-monorepo version publishing, you can omit the package name prefix e.g. `git tag v0.8.5`
      * `git push origin packagename-v0.8.5` push the tag up to GitHub
      * in a browser, go to the `sourcecred/sourcecred` repo homepage and click on 'Releases'
      * If a draft release has already been made for this version, click edit and enter the tag in the "tag" input box at the top, else:

        * click on the 'Tags' tab
        * click on the "..." on your new tag and click "Create release" in the dropdown (if one already exists, click edit and enter the tag in the "tag" input box at the top)
      * go back to the terminal to get your commit history to add to the release notes
      * in your first terminal window, run `git contributions packagename-v0.8.4...packagename-v0.8.5 > contributions.txt && cat contributions.txt` (using the last version number and the new version number)
      * copy the list of contributions, go back to your browser on the release page and paste the list of contributions into the text box at the very bottom with the title `# Contributions`
      * add relevant details to the release notes - anything that is important for instance maintainers to know that is a part of this release, for example:

        * documentation of how to use new commands
        * any breaking changes
    * Publish to NPM

      * **Make sure you've published the release notes before publishing to NPM** to ensure that the release notes are included in resultant dependabot pull requests
      * in your sourcecred/sourcecred terminal window, run `npm login` and enter your credentials when prompted
      * `yarn lerna publish from-package` and enter one-time password from your 2FA when prompted
      * in a browser, go to [the NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sourcecred) to make sure the package has updated properly
* **A fun interactive terminal function you can add to your (ba)(z)shrc:**

  * This will do all of the above instructions and has pause points that prompt you through the manual steps. It should also be re-run friendly in case you need to start over.
