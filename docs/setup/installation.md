title: Installation
---

The easiest way to install SourceCred is to fork the
[example repo](https://github.com/sourcecred/example-instance). This repo
contains scripts that will install SourceCred locally and set up an example
instance of SourceCred. This instance can then be configured to include just the
plugins you want and point to the data sources you care about.

If you want to build SourceCred from source (for instance to get bleeding edge
features) or to develop on it, see the
[Development Setup instructions](#development-setup).

## Installing from example instance

1. Clone the `example-instance` repo from SourceCredâ€™s GitHub:

`git clone https://github.com/sourcecred/example-instance.git`

2. Install SourceCred and its dependencies

If you don't have it, install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/). Then
run yarn to install SourceCred and its dependencies.

`yarn`

That's it! The installed instance with come with the latest stable release and
default configurations, including all plugins.

Next, you'll want to configure your instance by selecting which plugins to use
and configuring them. See the
[example-instance README](https://github.com/sourcecred/example-instance/blob/main/README.md)
for more details.
