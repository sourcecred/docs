The easiest way to install SourceCred is to fork the example repo[]. This repo contains scripts that will install SourceCred locally and set up an example instance of SourceCred that uses the latest stable release and default configurations, including all plugins. This instance can then be configured to include just the plugins you want and point to the data sources you are about.

Instructions on building SourceCred from source and developing on it, see Development Setup [] below.
