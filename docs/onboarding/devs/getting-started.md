title: 💻 Onboarding as a Software Dev
description: Recommended steps for getting involved on our team as a coder /
  software engineer.
---

Onboarding for a Software Dev is a little more straightforward than for other
contributor types, and has some distinct recommendations listed below. We still
encourage you to check out our broader
[Getting Involved guide](../../beta/get-involved), our `#🏁start-here` channel
in Discord, and the Community Call on Tuesdays, like anyone.

## Step 1: Orient

1. **Read**
   [our Github Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/blob/main/packages/sourcecred/CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. **Watch**

   1. [this Data Flow walk through](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1mykBgyezrkLnN6kSMWrfq4etrwuunqe6)
      and [accompanying diagram](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_luhteFo=/)
   2. [this Code Architecture walk through](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/16aApUtwqCmi4EX8Z6fkCJXJZCzh5wRTU)
      and [accompanying diagram](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lF3UvK4=/)

## Step 2: Jump in

1. Set up your development environment with the help of
   [this guide](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/tree/main/packages/sourcecred#development-setup)
   and [this one](../../guides/dev-env-setup). \
   Reach out on Discord for additional help as needed!
2. Join the **Dev Team Sprint Planning** meeting on Discord \
   (see our [calendar](https://sourcecred.io/calendar) for the current schedule).
   \
   We will help you find a good first task and/or someone to pair with. \
   We also welcome you to drop by our Social Coding sessions on the calendar to co-work
   with us.

If you want to contribute but you're not looking to mingle at our team meetings
right now, look at our
[Good First Issues](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/labels/good%20first%20issue)
and comment to let us know you're working on one.

You're also welcome to sync with us on Discord in the `#🛠dev-team` channel.

## Step 3: Deep learning

> The intention of these Lunch & Learns is to share SourceCred-specific
> technical knowledge to make up for our lack of docs.

Our events are recorded to build our knowledge base!
