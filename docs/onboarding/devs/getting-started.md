description: COMING SOON
---

Onboarding for a Software Dev is a little more straightforward than for other
contributor types, and has some distinct recommendations listed below. We still
encourage you to check out our broader
[Getting Involved guide](../../beta/get-involved), our #start-here channel in
Discord, and the Community Call on Tuesdays, like anyone.

## Step 1: Orient

1. Read
   [our Github Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/blob/main/packages/sourcecred/CONTRIBUTING.md)
1. Watch
   [this Code Architecture Walk Through](https://zoom.us/rec/share/Rv8t99k0bfPJbSwbBD7cX4wlcq-Ekf5-Ai9lvws4AxSDvD-khy546KahRYbpoZm8.6aP2NciutnkUTR-3?startTime=1620677252000)
   and [accompanying diagram](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lF3UvK4=/).

## Step 2: Jump in
1. Set up your development environment with the help of [this guide](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/tree/main/packages/sourcecred#development-setup) and [this one](../../guides/dev-env-setup). Reach out on Discord for additional help as needed!
1. Join the **Dev Sprint Planning** meeting on Discord (see our
   [calendar](https://sourcecred.io/calendar) for the current schedule). We will
   help you find a good first task and/or someone to pair with. We also welcome you
   to drop by our Social Coding sessions on the calender to co-work with us.
