##  What is Grain?

Grain is a community-specific digital currency which is issued on the basis of [Cred](/docs/beta/cred) scores. Grain represents how much a participant has supported that community, either through contributions or financial support. Grain can be used to pay participants, or for ‚ÄúBoosting‚Äù contributions or initiatives. 

Boosting allows a participant to burn Grain in order to increase the Cred of a specific contribution. Boosting acts as a way of helping to set the project‚Äôs values and priorities, and gives the Booster an increased say in the direction of the project. When you use Grain for Boosting, you get a share of the Cred for whatever you are Boosting, which in turn will earn you future Grain.

Projects can choose to issue their Grain as a cryptocurrency or token, for example by issuing Grain as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. This allows Grain to be a conduit with which a project can pay or financially reward participants.

Note that Grain does not _have_ to be tied to any actual monetary concept, such as cryptocurrency. A SourceCred project can name it ‚ÄúPoints‚Äù and use it solely as a scoring system in addition to Cred values.

## How you earn Grain

Grain is created during what we call ‚ÄúHarvests.‚Äù A Harvest is a two-step process in which the Cred is recomputed (so scores are as fresh as possible), and Grain is then distributed based on those Cred scores.

By default, projects re-compute Cred every 6 hours, but only distribute Grain once a week: on Sunday morning, UTC time. Thus, the project has a full harvest only once per week.

#### Grain Distribution Policies
SourceCred currently has two policies for how a project distributes Grain:

- `IMMEDIATE` splits Grain evenly based on how much Cred each participant earned last week. (This policy ignores all Cred from previous weeks, and is intended to give fast rewards to active participants.)
- `BALANCED` splits Grain based both on lifetime Cred and on lifetime Grain earnings. Balanced tries to ensure that everyone in the project receives a total Grain payment which is consistent with their total Cred score. For example, suppose that a contributor used to have a low Cred score, and as such received a small amount of Grain. However, the community recently changed its weights, or added a new plugin, such that the contributor now has a larger amount of Cred. The balanced policy sees that this contributor is underpaid, so it will pay them extra to "catch them up" to others in the project. Conversely, contributors might be "overpaid", and they'll receive less Grain until the payouts have been equalized.


### _‚ÄúWhat if I contributed a lot before a small Grain distribution, and then less before a bigger Grain distribution?‚Äù_

Since Cred is retroactive, the SourceCred algorithm will make sure your percentage is based on _all_ of your contributions compared to all existing contributions, and make sure your percentage is based on the total amount of Grain that has been issued to the community. _Ever._ 


## How much is Grain worth?

In the SourceCred community, Grain stays at a fixed price of $1 per Grain. However, each community can choose the price of their Grain, as well as a name for their specific kind of Grain. In other words, Grain is project-specific, and it‚Äôs not a universal token. Every project that uses SourceCred creates its own independent token and calls it whatever they choose. Grain in the SourceCred community is sometimes also called ‚ÄúSourceGrain,‚Äù to distinguish it from other projects‚Äô Grain tokens.

As for pricing, each community can choose the price of their own Grain. They can choose a fixed price, or choose to make their Grain a floating financial asset and let the market decide the price; their Grain would then fluctuate in price based on supply and demand. 


## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Boosting Contributions

Grain can also be used to Boost contributions. This means you can burn your Grain to support a particular contribution. When a contribution is Boosted, its Cred increases because new Cred has just been [Minted](/docs/beta/cred#-cred-minting). It then also flows a fraction of its Cred to its Booster.

Boosting is a flexible mechanism. A Booster can use it to prioritize work and incentivize participants to focus on it. For example, if there is a bug that you really want fixed, you can Boost it. Since it has a higher Cred score from the newly Minted Cred, participants will now be more interested in focusing on it, as they will receive more Cred from their work.

Boosters can also hunt for under-valued contributions and Boost them. They are incentivized to do so, because if the contribution is later seen as important, they will receive a bunch of Cred as its Booster. In doing so, they help to ensure that everyone‚Äôs contributions are being fairly valued.

A guide on how to use Grain for Boosting will be coming soon.

## Other key properties of Grain

### Grain is transferrable and tradeable.

You can send your Grain freely to others, or exchange it as part of an agreement. Within a project, Grain is fungible. If Grain has been put on a blockchain (e.g. as an ERC20 token), it can be swapped or traded via protocols like Uniswap or 0x, just like any other ERC20 token.

### Grain is opt-in

Since Grain can have financial value, receiving Grain might create legal and/or tax complications for participants. As such, Grain is opt-in; only participants that have explicitly opted in will be eligible to receive any Grain. **Note:** This is in contrast to Cred, which is _not_ an asset, and which all participants receive automatically.
