As a community, we value:

## CARE

**We take care of ourselves and each other.** We value compassion,
self-awareness, empathy, and healing. We strive to honor the inherent basic
dignity of all people through our communications and actions. We recognize that
without personal commitments to our shadow work, we cannot sustainably take care
of ourselves and each other.

## SOVEREIGNTY

**We own our labor and value our free will.** We strive to heal from
coercion-based relationships to work, we support ourselves and each other in our
journeys toward self-sovereignty, and prioritize our collective autonomy. We
practice consent culture.

## TRUST

**We move at the speed of trust.** We value collaboration, accountability,
meaningful transparency, and integrity. We measure our collective stability by
the strength of our relationships.

## LIBERATION

**Liberation is at the center.** We respond to power dynamics in real time, we
break down accessibility barriers in real time, we strive to learn and unlearn.
We embrace the paradox of intolerance.

## EMERGENCE

**We value the dynamic over the status quo.** We see the challenges we face
culturally and technically as the sign posts for the directions we should move
in. We value curiosity and experimentation.

## DECENTRALIZATION

**We share power.** We share information, work, and decision-making between our
many selves. No one person is in charge of everything, either in responsibility
or authority. We value leader-full action, not leaderless action. We create
contributions that are transparently recorded, well-defined/contained, and easy
to build on.
