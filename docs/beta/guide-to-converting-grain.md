* ## **Step by Step (Desktop)**

  * **Convert Grain to DAI**

    * Open a [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/dashboard) account. For this you will need to link a bank account.
    * Fill out the [Grain Sale Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScE2orIAyY-N7Qc4P4XFgv-Es1UwH3gJ2U_40TVTYMEZ-gDBA/viewform) and send to \[[PanchoMiguel]] on Discord. You will need to know:

      * How much Grain you want to convert. You can check the [Grain Ledger](http://cred.sourcecred.io/#/accounts) to see how much Grain you have available. Grain in the SourceCred community is distributed every Sunday.
      * Choose the ETH address would you like DAI sent to. In the upper right hand corner of Coinbase, there is the word "Receive." Click this, select "DAI" for your currency, and copy the address. This is your ETH address. You must copy the address *after* you choose your currency, as the address is different for each currency.
  * **Convert DAI to USD and withdraw from cryptowallet**

    * The next step is to withdraw your USD from your cryptowallet and have it sent to your linked bank account. You have two choices:

      * a) You can use [CoinbasePro](https://pro.coinbase.com/) *(recommended)*, which is automatically linked to your Coinbase account. CoinbasePro is free and converts DAI to USD instantly. The site may look complicated, but don't let that scare you, using it can be simple. To do this, you will need to transfer the DAI from your Coinbase wallet to your CoinbasePro wallet. Even though Coinbase is automatically linked to CoinbasePro, they are separate wallets.

        * **NOTE FOR MIGUEL** - Is Coinbase Pro instant in converting DAI to USD, or is it instant in sending USD to your bank account? When I used Pro to send to my bank account, it said it woudl take 3-5 business days but in the next step said it would be instant.

        * Then click Deposit and select DAI.
        * Select the bottom option, Coinbase.com, and select an amount. You have now transferred your DAI to your CoinbasePro wallet.
        * On the [CoinbasePro Trading page](https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/DAI-USD), click Sell and select the amount you would like to sell.
        * DAI is a stable coin, but it does fluctuate by about 1/1000th of a penny throughout the day. Because of this, you need to let your *limit price,* the price you want your DAI to sell for. The orange and green numbers that are moving on your screen are the updated price of DAI over time. Pick any of those numbers (it will be around 1.0078) and type that in your "Limit" box. When the DAI market hits that price again, (possibly in a matter of seconds) the conversion will be made.
        * Next, you need to withdraw your USD from your cryptowallet and send it to your linked bank account. Click "Portfolio' in the upper right hand corner.
        * Click "Withdraw" and select USD.
        * Select "Bank Account" and choose your amount. A 2-factor authentication code will be sent to your phone.
      * b) You can use [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/dashboard) to convert your DAI to a currency of your choice. This costs *how much?* and takes 2-3 days to reach your bank account.

        * Go to your portfolio, scroll down and click DAI.
        * Click Overview.
