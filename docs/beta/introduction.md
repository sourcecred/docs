description: An introduction to SourceCred's values and goals

SourceCred is an open-source tool for communities to measure and reward value
creation.

We're building SourceCred because we believe our society's value system is broken.
It values people based on their credentials or job titles, not based on the true
values they bring--especially if that value is "soft value" like emotional
labor or leadership. It values organizations based on the profits they can
capture, not the broader effects they have on society. It values the environment
in terms of the resources we can harvest from it, not the role it plays in
sustaining our collective existence.

SourceCred offers a new perspective on value. First, we don't think value is
universal. It's contextual (intersubjective), and different communities will
have different perspectives on what is or isn't valuable. For that reason,
SourceCred is an open-source project that any community can set up, tweak, or
reconfigure based on their own needs.

Second, we don't think value is about *transactions*, but rather, about *relationships*.
SourceCred doesn't try to assign a dollar score or price to any contribution or
person. Instead, every contribution or contributor earns
[Cred](concepts/cred.md) based on their connections to other
contributions, and how much Cred those other contributions earn.
Mathematically, we do this by constructing a network of contributions called a
Contribution Graph, and then running the CredRank algorithm on it.

Finally, we acknowledge that in order to be sustainable, communities need to
interact with the "real world" economy of dollars and cents. For that reason,
every community can issue [Grain](concepts/grain.md), a community-specific
cryptocurrency. Grain is then distributed based on contributor Cred scores.
Sponsors purchase Grain, and then use it for [Boosting](concepts/boosting.md), 
which allows them to influence Cred scores, and thus the community's priorities.
Basically, Sponsors help make the community economically viable, and in return
the community gives sponsors some infuence over the community's goals, values,
and priorities.

In the short term, SourceCred is focused on supporting open-source crypto
projects. Crypto projects are an ideal fit because they need a way to
distribute the tokens that they natively generate, and need a decentralized,
"new-world" appraoch to do so-- "old world" approaches of corporations and
shareholder value just don't fit. The key early adopter is the SourceCred
project itself: we have no corporate structure and no investors, but we reward
everyone in the community via Cred and Grain. (Big thanks to [Protocol
Labs](https://protocol.ai/) for being our first and biggest sponsor.) We're
also thrilled to be partnered with other awesome and idealistic projects like
[MetaGame](https://metagame.wtf/) and
[AraCred](https://aracred.github.io/website/).

In the medium term, we want to make the whole open-source ecosystem
economically sustainable. The core idea of open source is that we can make
better technology, and empower more people, if we give away our work for free
rather than encumbering it with licenses and paywalls. This is an incredibly
powerful idea, but it's held back from its full potential because it depends on
unpaid and overworked volunteers. Once enough open-source projects are using
SourceCred, we will create a "MetaCred" instance that flows Cred and Grain
across the open-source dependency graph. This will ensure that every project in
the ecosystem--from flashy user-facing projects to the core infrastructure they
depend on--will share in the success of the ecosystem. The result will be a
golden age of flourishing open-source.

In the long run, we hope that SourceCred can help unlock big transformations to
align the world economy with our shared values. So many of the thorny problems
facing society seem to come down to us valuing the wrong things. We put a price
on medicines when we should be valuing healthiness. We compensate investment
bankers when we should be appreciating teachers. We "redevelop" rainforests
when we should be stewarding them. We hope SourceCred will unlock the paradigm
shift we need so that we can collectively re-orient.

If you'd like to [get involved](get-involved.md) we'd love to
have you. We don't care about college degrees or credentials. There's no
whiteboard interview. If you have skills, creativity, or empathy to offer, then
come earn some Cred. ðŸ˜‰
