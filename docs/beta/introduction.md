Welcome to your new favorite rabbit hole. This doc will offer you a basic
overview of the different concepts that make up SourceCred and provide you with
links to additional documentation so you can keep exploring and feeding your
curiosity.

We hope you enjoy the journey.

## So what IS SourceCred?

SourceCred (in the most basic sense) is a technology that makes the labor of
individuals more visible and rewardable as they work together in a project or
community. The goal of SourceCred is to use this technology to make rewarding
labor as nuanced as human contribution often is. We hope to be one piece in the
puzzle of a healthier future where systems serve community members, where
financial maximization isn't the end-all be-all goal, and where wealth actually
flows to those who are creating the value in our world.

## SourceCred's Core Concepts

### Cred

SourceCred uses an algorithm to determine how much value a contribution or
contributor added to a project overall. When a contribution is made to a
project, SourceCred's purpose is to "see" that contribution and assign it an
amount of "Cred" based on how much value it brought to the project as a whole.

That Cred flows from the contribution to all the people and other contributions
that supported it. In this way, you can imagine how a project could be
represented as a "node graph" made up of contribution and people dots (aka
"nodes") connected by lines (aka "edges") that flow Cred around to the nodes
based on what supported what. The more edges one contribution has to other
important contributions in the project, the more Cred is going to have an
opportunity to flow to it along the edges. In this way, it's easy to tell by the
Cred score which contributions (and contributors) are truly foundational and
support future work in the project.

So how does an algorithm determine how much someone's work is worth in the
bigger picture of a project? Sounds a little dystopian, right? The algorithm
uses what we call "Weights", which are a set of rules stating which types of
contributions are worth what amounts of Cred. The Weights for Cred distribution
are decided by each community individually, thereby giving every community the
opportunity to decide what it values and which actions uphold those values as
they work together to create something. Every community using SourceCred can
decide for themselves what is valuable and deserving of Cred, and what is not.

Cred is "non-transferable" in that you cannot sell your Cred, or buy someone
else's Cred. It is solely a representation of where value in the project has
been created.

[How Cred Works](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/cred) documentation.

### Grain

On its own, Cred may be a nice signal of what is valuable and who is really
doing the work to make your project successful, but it's hard to pay rent or buy
dinner with a Cred score. That's where "Grain" comes in.

Grain is a project-specific digital currency which is minted and distributed to
contributors who have Cred in that project. Your Grain is tied to your Cred; as
you earn Cred, you also earn Grain. Unlike Cred, Grain is a form of currency and
is meant to be transferable both inside and outside of the project.

##### Ways you might end up with Grain in a project that's using SourceCred:

- You worked directly as a contributor, earning Cred -and therefore Grain- in
  that project.
- You bought Grain with another valuable currency (like ETH or Dollars) from a
  contributor in that project.

So how is Grain useful? The transferability of Grain makes it a powerful tool in
a number of different ways depending on how your project and/or community is
operating. Perhaps you have funding already, but don't know how to distribute
it. Maybe you'd like to use it as a tool for governance. Or maybe you'd like a
way to allow people outside the project to financially support what you're doing
by buying the Grain.

Part of what makes Grain (and SourceCred) so powerful is that it can be applied
in many different ways based on the needs and parameters of the community.

##### Examples of how a project might use Grain:

- Paying contributors with grants or funds it already has based on Cred/Grain.
- Creating a project-specific currency that can be traded for other forms of
  currency (ie: ETH or US Dollars).
- Creating an internal currency that could be used solely for governance or to
  show support for features/ideas.

##### Examples of how an individual might use Grain:

- Selling their grain back to the project in exchange for money from the
  project's budget (essentially wages you can claim by selling your Grain).
- "Boosting" specific initiatives, ideas, goals, etc in the project by "burning"
  some of their Grain to make more Cred for that initiative. And creating a
  small flow of Cred from the initiative back to themselves as a bonus.
- Selling their Grain to people or groups outside the project who would like to
  use it for Boosting and incentivizing certain features/decisions.

dogfooding!).

## SourceCred's Vision

- Outcompeting capitalism

  - Creating a system to replace capitalism is important to dismantling the
    harmful systems we live within

- Creating better structures for recognizing labor that's currently "invisible"

  - The nuance of value and a wider recognition of it (eg: emotional labor)
  - Better access to opportunity

- More equitable and ethical payment systems

  - Decoupling hours worked from money paid
  - The bias of payment and privilege of negotiation
  - Moving away from cost of replacement and towards rewarding of sustainable
    value created

- Better interpersonal and collaborative tools

  - Community playbook
  - Self-directed/remote work environments become more possible

- Growth plan and concrete strategy

  - Supporting crypto and open source to create better-functioning economic
    ecosystems

- Shifting priorities in line with values on a micro and macro level

## How can I engage with SourceCred?

There are two ways you can really get your hands into SourceCred.

### Use SourceCred in your community:

Smaller communities with emotional maturity that have high technical
understanding of software development and economics are best suited for using
SourceCred in its young state. To get a better idea of whether your community
would do well using this early version of SourceCred, check out our
[FAQ](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/FAQ) and
[How to Set Up SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/setup-guide)
documentation.

Setting up an instance of SourceCred, reviewing the Cred calculations it
creates, and playing with weights can be a great way to start evaluating if
SourceCred is a good fit for you and your project/community. If we're not ready
to support your kind of project yet, check back in later. We're improving all
the time.

### Contribute to building SourceCred:

SourceCred is dogfooding itself, meaning that we use the technology we're
creating to calculate our own Cred scores and distribute Grain to those who help
build and support it. If you are interested in getting involved with the
SourceCred community, read through our
[Getting Involved with SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/get-involved)
doc and join the main conversation in our
[Discord](https://sourcecred.io/discord).

From there, you'll be able to learn more about our community and feel out where
you can best contribute. We encourage all types of skillful people to get
involved; from software engineers, to artists, to economics enthusiasts, to
those with emotional intelligence and "soft skills". No degrees required. So
come join the conversation and see if there's a place for you to earn some Cred
in SourceCred!
