# Editor's Preface:

This doc is still on the journey to be ready for the public eye. I (LB) as the latest author have left spaces to add content where I don't feel I'm able to fully communicate the point. As you edit this, add content in the sections where you have expertise. I've left descriptions of the content that should exist in *\[italicized brackets]* so that all you need to do is fill in that missing paragraph. 

Let's not pre-publish this one until all the content exists and we can remove this "editor's preface" and all the italicized descriptions.

SourceCred is an open-source tool for communities to measure and reward value
creation.

*\[get a better tagline]*

# The Problem

*\[Set up the problems we're trying to solve for in a compelling and relatable way that guides people to seeing some of the major systemic issues caused by financial maximization. Highlight the toxic mechanisms that most people take for granted in our society.]*

We're building SourceCred because we believe the way we value things is broken.
We value people based on their credentials or job titles, not based on the true
values they bring--especially if that value is "soft value" like emotional
labor or leadership. We value organizations based on the profits they can
capture, not the broader effects they have on society. We value the environment
in terms of the resources we can harvest from it, not on the role it plays in
sustaining our collective existence.

# Imagine a Different World

*\[Describe the "new perspective on value" that SourceCred creates in an imaginative \*and\* concrete way. Take the reader on a small journey of what value could mean, and show examples of the impacts it would have on our future experience as individuals, communities, and societies. Paint a picture that gives hope and direction after being shown the problem of our current reality.]*

SourceCred offers a new perspective on value. First, we don't think value is
universal. It's contextual (intersubjective), and different communities will
have different perspectives on what is or isn't valuable. 

# The Solution of SourceCred

*[Make the connection for the reader that SourceCred is the bridge from point A (today's society and its problems) to point B (the vision we painted a picture of).*\
*This is where you can give a succinct description of SC's:*

* *basic functions and features (the nuts and bolts like cred, grain, boosting, contribution graphs, et)*
* *the connection between algorithm and a community's social norms which makes SourceCred more finessed, aligned, empowering, and less game-able.*
* *the economic functions and effects which make SC a rational and intelligent choice that interacts well with the reality of money.]*

For that reason,
SourceCred is an open-source project which any community can set up, tweak, or
reconfigure based on their own needs.

Second, we think value isn't about *transactions*, but about *relationships*.
SourceCred doesn't try to assign a dollar score or price to any contribution or
person. Instead, every contribution or contributor earns
[Cred](concepts/cred.md) based on how it was connected to other
contributions, and how much Cred those other contributions earned.
Mathematically, we do this by constructing a network of contributions called a
Contribution Graph, and then running the CredRank algorithm on it.

Finally, we acknowledge that in order to be sustainable, communities need to
interact with the "real world" economy of dollars and cents. For that reason,
every community can issue [Grain](concepts/grain.md), a community-specific
cryptocurrency. Grain is distributed based on Cred, so it is all earned by
community members and contributors. Sponsors purchase Grain, and then use it
for [Boosting](concepts/boosting.md), which allows them to influence the
Cred scores, and thus the community's priorities. Basically, Sponsors help make
the community economically viable, and in gratitude the community gives
sponsors some infuence over the community's goals, values, and priorities.

# The Strategy

*\[Give an overview of the overall short, medium, and long-term visions to the degree that is appropriate for a public-facing doc.]*

In the short term, SourceCred is focused on supporting open-source crypto
projects. Crypto projects are an ideal fit because they need a way to
distribute the tokens that they natively generate, and need a decentralized,
"new-world" appraoch for doing so--the old world approaches of corporations and
shareholder value just don't fit. The key early adopter is the SourceCred
project itself: we have no corporate structure and no investors, but we reward
everyone in the community via Cred and Grain. (Big thanks to [Protocol
Labs](https://protocol.ai/) for being our first and biggest sponsor.) We're
also thrilled to be partnered with other awesome and idealistic projects like
[MetaGame](https://metagame.wtf/) and
[AraCred](https://aracred.github.io/website/).

In the medium term, we want to make the whole open-source ecosystem
economically sustainable. The core idea of open source is that we can make
better technology, and empower more people, if we give away our work for free
rather than encumbering it with licenses and paywalls. This is an incredibly
powerful idea, but it's held back from its full potential because it depends on
unpaid and overworked volunteers. Once enough open-source projects are using
SourceCred, we will create a "MetaCred" instance that flows Cred and Grain
across the open-source dependency graph. This will ensure that every project in
the ecosystem--from flashy user-facing projects to the core infrastructure they
depend on--will share in the success of the ecosystem. The result will be a
golden age of flourishing open-source.

In the long run, we hope that SourceCred can help unlock big transformations to
align the world economy with our shared values. So many of the thorny problems
facing society seem to come down to us valuing the wrong things. We put a price
on medicines when we should be valuing healthiness. We compensate investment
bankers when we should be appreciating teachers. We "redevelop" rainforests
when we should be stewarding them. We hope SourceCred will unlock the paradigm
shift we need so that we can collectively re-orient.

# Our Community

\[Bring the reader around to the sensation of SourceCred as a functioning community with goals, not just a lofty idea and a lot of theories but no action. Highlight the sensation that we are an actual group of people working together successfully to bring this vision to reality.]

If you'd like to [get involved](get-involved.md) we'd love to
have you. We don't care about college degrees or credentials. There's no
whiteboard interview. If you have skills, creativity, or empathy to offer, then
come earn some Cred. ðŸ˜‰
