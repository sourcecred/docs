  "See the various calls: the meetings, work sessions, and social events for the
  SourceCred community."

SourceCred is a community in which most contributors are remote and work
asynchronously, allowing anyone to contribute no matter their location and
availability. We hold regularly scheduled calls, open to everyone, to cultivate
a culture of joyful collaboration and meaningful connection between members.
These calls have different specific purposes (and expectations), and are held on
the [SourceCred Discord server](https://sourcecred.io/discord) using the voice
and video channels.

You can see what types of calls are currently scheduled on our
[public calendar](http://sourcecred.io/calendar).

## Weekly Community Call

**What:** The founder and members of the core team host a call for any newcomers
or community members to attend, introduce themselves, ask questions, etc.

**Perfect for** anyone who is interested in SourceCred, especially newcomers.

**Purpose:** To provide newcomers with the opportunity to get to know the
project and its main team, or ask any questions they have about SourceCred.

**When:** Weekly, please check the calendar as this meeting is occasionally
cannibalized for other emergent contributor needs.
[**Tuesday** at 11am Pacific Time](https://sourcecred.io/calendar) on the
[SourceCred Discord](https://sourcecred.io/discord).

## Weekly Contributor Call (on hiatus)

**What:** A weekly call helping contributors be on the same page about larger
goals, getting feedback on projects/initiatives, and unblocking people where
needed.

**Perfect for** all people actively contributing to SourceCred, or simply anyone
wanting to be tuned into the larger picture. If you are about to start
contributing, you are welcome to listen in as a way to gain context, but please
be mindful not to derail conversations with too many clarifying questions. If
you find yourself lost at the Contributor Call, attend a Community Call instead,
which is the best place to ask questions to your heart’s content.

**Note:** Being a contributor does not make this meeting mandatory for you.

**Purpose:** This call gives all of the contributors the opportunity to see the
bigger picture and align their actions and priorities with the overall goals of
the project. It also gives the branch leads a chance to get feedback and
assistance on larger goals or changes. It helps grow a sense of connection and
shared goals across different portions of SourceCred.

**When:** Weekly,
[**Thursday** at 11am Pacific Time](https://sourcecred.io/calendar) on the
[SourceCred Discord](https://sourcecred.io/discord).

## Weekly Book Club: Emergent Strategy

**What:** A social event! [note: we're almost done reading this book, stay
tuned\ what's next!]

**Perfect for** anyone who wants to authentically participate.

**Purpose:** To chill, read, and discuss. Typically a pretty vulnerable,
intimate space full of personal sharing.

**Where:** Discord Main voice channel.

**When:** Currently Mondays 2:15-3:45 PST. Check the
[SourceCred Calendar](https://sourcecred.io/calendar) for any changes.

## Soap Boxes

**What:** A designated time to talk aloud about a specific subject and how it
may or may not relate to SourceCred.

**Perfect for** anyone who finds that particular topic interesting or relevant.

**Purpose:** To let out steam, to align or to see where we may not align; to
allow a social space to speak uninterrupted about general or controversial
topics. Has MC and allows for uninterrupted, times shares.

**Where:** Typically in the Watercooler channel.

**When:** No set time or reoccurrence. Soap boxes are scheduled as one-off
events, and timing is usually based off the availability of the MC. Check out
the [SourceCred Calendar](https://sourcecred.io/calendar) to see upcoming Soap
boxes.

## Working/Discussion Group Meetings

**What:** Meetings for contributors working in a specific domain to coordinate,
check in on progress, and align goals and action with each other.

**Primarily for** the contributors who are working on initiatives within that
domain. Listeners or "flies on the wall" welcome.

**Purpose:** Keeps teams effective, aligned, and communicating. Helps grow a
sense of connection and shared goals within the branch. Gives contributors a
chance to receive help, propose new ideas, communicate changes, and problem
solve.

**Where:** Discord Main voice channel.

**When:** At a regular day/time of the team’s choosing. Find them on the
[SourceCred Calendar](https://sourcecred.io/calendar).

## Weekly Social Coding

**What:** Typically a long scheduled session for devs to co-work, problem-solve,
or parallel work together on the product.

**Perfect for** the contributors who are developers and weekly participants in
the Monday backlog grooming and sprints.

**Purpose:** Creating a synchronous space to really make progress on an
initiative or project. Long, open time slots allow for focus. We try not to
schedule other events during social coding to prevent FOMO from the devs who are
focussing on the sourcecode.

**Where:** Co-working or Quiet Co-working channels.

**When:** Scheduled weekly; times change according to group dev availability.

## One-on-Ones (1:1)

**What:** Time scheduled with another contributor, often someone who has more
context in the project than yourself, for the purpose of gaining context, asking
questions, expressing concerns, getting assistance, or sharing interesting
ideas.

**Note:** One-on-ones take place over personal DM voice or video call, unlike
our regular calls (which happen in the main Discord meeting room).

**Perfect for** a newer contributor and a higher-context contributor, but
certainly not limited to that dynamic. Consider reaching out for a one-on-one
with someone in the org if you haven't yet after 6 Community Calls! If you have
already, that's awesome.

**Purpose:** 1:1s are an accepted and foundational contribution to the
SourceCred community. It's one of the things that sets up apart in many ways
too: that we turn inward and focus on one another and the individual as well as
organizational relationships we build in addition to a relationship to the
product (dogfooding).

The reasons for a 1:1 are varied. You may have a friend in the community who is
helping you dip your toes into SourceCred for the first time, or perhaps you
work on a different project and would like to ask questions of a specific
contributor about integrations with SourceCred, or maybe you’ve been to a bunch
of community calls and would like a guide/mentor you can touch bases with about
your how to get involved.

**Where:** Typically the Watercooler channel or a personal message.

**When:** At the discretion of the participants.
