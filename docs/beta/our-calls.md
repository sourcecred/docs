title: ☎️ Our Calls
description: See the various calls, meetings, work sessions, and jams the
  SourceCred community has on a regular basis.
---
SourceCred is a community in which most contributors are remote and work
asynchronously, allowing anyone to contribute no matter their location and
availability. We hold regularly scheduled calls which are open to everyone, to cultivate
a culture of collaboration and meaningful connection between members.
These calls have different specific purposes (and expectations), and are held on
the [SourceCred Discord server](https://sourcecred.io/discord) using the audio channels.

You can see what types of calls are currently scheduled on our[ public calendar](http://sourcecred.io/calendar).

# Weekly Calls

## Community Call (on hiatus)

**What:** The Community Call is a great space for newcomers and experienced community members alike. We take time to check in with each other as people, and get to know the newer folks. Come join us and share a bit about who you are, why you're curious about SourceCred, and what you like to work on. It's also a great way to get to know the other participants and ask any questions you may have about who we are and what we do. 

**Perfect for** anyone who is interested in SourceCred, especially newcomers.

**Purpose:** To provide newcomers with the opportunity to get to know the project and its main team, or ask any questions they have about SourceCred.

**When: Currently on hiatus.** Weekly, [**Tuesday** at 11am Pacific Time](https://sourcecred.io/calendar) on the [SourceCred Discord](https://sourcecred.io/discord). This meeting is occasionally cannibalized for other emergent contributor needs, so check the calendar to confirm. 

## Weekly Update 

**What:** Community members share updates about each major portion of the project as well as potential opportunities to help. This is a weekly call aimed primarily at contributors, people who want to contribute, and anyone who wants to learn about latest work being done in SourceCred. This call gives contributors the opportunity to see the bigger picture and align their actions and priorities with the overall goals of the project. It also gives contributors a chance to get feedback and assistance on larger goals or changes. It helps grow a sense of connection and shared goals across different portions of SourceCred.

**Perfect for** participants who are actively contributing to SourceCred, as well as anyone who would like to be in-tune with the larger picture. 

If you are about to start contributing, you are welcome to listen in on this call as a way to gain context and offer your help. However, please be mindful not to derail conversations with too many clarifying questions. **If you find yourself lost at the Weekly Update, attend a Community Call next.** The Community Call is the best place to ask questions of any type or level of knowledge.

**Note:** Being a participant does not make this meeting mandatory for you.

**When:** Weekly,[ **F**riday at 11am Pacific Time](https://sourcecred.io/calendar) on the[ SourceCred Discord](https://sourcecred.io/discord).

## Book Club: Emergent Strategy[](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/our-calls#weekly-book-club-emergent-strategy "Direct link to heading") (on hiatus)

**What:** A social event! \[note: we're almost done reading this book, stay tuned what's next!] We gather to chill, read, and discuss. Typically a pretty vulnerable, intimate space full of personal sharing.

**Perfect for** anyone who wants to authentically participate.

**When:** **Currently on hiatus.** Usually Mondays 2:15-3:45 PST on the [SourceCred Discord](https://sourcecred.io/discord). Check the [SourceCred Calendar](https://sourcecred.io/calendar) for any changes.

# Ad-Hoc Calls

## Jams

A Jam is an open and moderately unstructured call for interested participants to brainstorm about or dive into a specific topic. From crypto-economics to values, from legal and regulation to community-care; topics for Jams can be anything that relates to SourceCred in some way. Schedule a Jam whenever you see that there's a lot of desire to talk about something together, but no time in \*this\* meeting. 

Jams can be scheduled by anyone who'd like to host one, and often get put on the calendar when it becomes obvious that everyone really wants to keep talking about a topic. 

**What:** A designated time to talk about a specific subject and how it relates to
SourceCred.

**Perfect for** anyone who finds that particular topic interesting or relevant
to their work in SourceCred.

**Purpose:** We come together to explore a specific topic, and how we can apply it
to SourceCred or vice-versa. Jams are a fun, low-barrier way to get involved in
the project.

**When:** No set time or reoccurrence. Jams are scheduled as one-off events, and
timing is usually based off the availability of key participants. Check out the
[SourceCred Calendar](https://sourcecred.io/calendar) to see upcoming Jams.

## Town Halls

**What:** 

**Perfect for** community members.

**Purpose:** 

**Where:** Typically in the main meeting room channel.

**When:** No set time or reoccurrence. Town Halls are scheduled as one-off events. Check out the [SourceCred Calendar](https://sourcecred.io/calendar) to see upcoming Town Halls.

## Trunk, Branch, or Team-Specific Meetings

**What:** Meetings for contributors working in a specific branch to coordinate,
check in on progress, and align goals and action with each other and the branch
lead.

**Primarily for** the contributors who are working on initiatives within that
specific branch, and the branch lead.

**Purpose:** Keeps teams effective, aligned, and communicating. Helps grow a sense
of connection and shared goals within the branch. Gives contributors a chance to
receive help, propose new ideas, and communicate changes.

**Where:** Discord Main voice channel.

**When:** At a regular day/time of the team’s choosing. Find them on the
[SourceCred Calendar](https://sourcecred.io/calendar).

## Work Sessions

**What:** A generally shorter and faster-paced session scheduled for a specific team
to come together and make progress on a specific goal or initiative. Having
shorter sessions with an emphasis on getting a few singular goals completed can
make these sessions more productive than regular meetings.

**Perfect for** the contributors on a team that is actively working on a
specific initiative, and any other high-context contributors they need feedback
from. Anyone who plans to start contributing to the specific initiative in
question can attend to gain context.

**Purpose:** Creating a synchronous space with all the key players to really make
progress on an initiative or project. By nature of being shorter, these are also
less taxing and can help keep contributors on track.

**When:** Scheduled as one-off events when asynchronous coordination won’t cut it.

## Soap Boxes[](https://sourcecred.io/docs/beta/our-calls#soap-boxes "Direct link to heading")

**What:** A designated time to talk aloud about a specific subject and how it may or may not relate to SourceCred.

**Perfect for** anyone who finds that particular topic interesting or relevant.

**Purpose:** To let out steam, to align or to see where we may not align; to allow a social space to speak uninterrupted about general or controversial topics. Has MC and allows for uninterrupted, times shares.

**Where:** Typically in the Watercooler channel.

**When:** No set time or reoccurrence. Soap boxes are scheduled as one-off events, and timing is usually based off the availability of the MC. Check out the [SourceCred Calendar](https://sourcecred.io/calendar) to see upcoming Soap Boxes.

## One-on-Ones (1:1)

**What:** Time scheduled with another contributor, often someone who has more
context in the project than yourself, for the purpose of gaining context, asking
questions, expressing concerns, getting assistance, or sharing interesting
ideas.

**Note:** One-on-ones take place over personal DM voice or video call, unlike
our regular calls (which happen in the main Discord meeting room).

**Perfect for** a newer contributor and a higher-context contributor, but
certainly not limited to that dynamic.

**Purpose:** The reasons for a 1:1 are varied. You may have a friend in the
community who is helping you dip your toes into SourceCred for the first time,
or perhaps you work on a different project and would like to ask questions of a
specific contributor about integrations with SourceCred, or maybe you’ve been in
the community for a while and would like a guide/mentor you can touch bases with
about your SourceCred experience from time to time.

**When:** At the discretion of the participants.
