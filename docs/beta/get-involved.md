  A guide for becoming a contributor in SourceCred’s internal community.

If you are interested in joining the community of contributors who are working
together to make SourceCred a reality, then this page will help you find your
way. If instead you’re looking for information about using SourceCred for your
own community or project, check out our
[How To Set Up SourceCred](/docs/beta/setup-guide) guide.

This document is under construction! as our community is undergoing a huge shift
at the moment. Thank you for your patience! We want to be clear and accurate in
our depiction of the project and how to get involved. We'll be back with a
clearer vision of what to expect as soon as we know ourselves.
