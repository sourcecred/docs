### bikeshedding

Bikeshedding means talking (or even arguing) about a small detail instead of a larger issue at hand. 
If you imagine building a house and having a bike shed outside, it would be akin
to angsting over the color and fun name for the bike shed instead of working on
actually finishing the house. At the end of the day, you won't have a place to live
because you were lost in details that didn't matter.

#### In the wild

If you take a look at [sourcecred](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred/search?q=bikeshedding&type=Issues), there are several instances of a mention of bikeshedding.
Here is an example from @decentralion:

> It would probably be best to split this into two PRs, one which adds the badges and one which adds the colors, as color choices are always an ample source of bikeshedding :)

In the above statement, they recognize that contributors are likely to get distracted
with color choices, and suggests splitting a piece of work into two parts to not
hold up adding the badges.
