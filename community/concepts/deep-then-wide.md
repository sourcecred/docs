# deep then wide

SourceCred is still a very young project. As we grow it, we have a choice of priorities: 

 - do we want to go "wide" (adoption by lots of projects) or 
 - "deep" (intensive usage by a few projects)?

If you are familiar with depth vs. breadth when it comes to searching, this idea
is similar to that. In the next sections, we'll talk about each option, and
what it would mean for development and the future of the project.

#### What does it mean to go wide?

Going "wide" is easier. SourceCred can run on any GitHub repository, so we have a path for engagement with the entire GitHub community. We could focus on getting more and more projects to try running SourceCred, and then convert them to regular usage. If we went down this route, we would focus on features that make the existing cred scores more salient and engaging — for example, making it easy to generate "weekly reports" showing the new cred being earned by contributors.

As an added bonus to going wide, progress is much easier to measure, as it’s easier to quantify the number of projects using SourceCred, but hard to quantify the amount of value that SourceCred is adding to any particular project.

#### What does it mean to go deep?

Going "deep" is more challenging. It means finding a way to make SourceCred deeply and durably valuable to individual communities — not as a passing interest, but as something that gets a lot of community engagement, and becomes a part of how that community operates and thinks about itself.

Why would we want to go deep first? It would mean tackling the harder parts first, and
focusing on the needs of the SourceCred community. Until SourceCred can do a good or even
optimal job of assigning cred within SourceCred itself, it's not ready for sharing with other
communities. Once this is a reality (and we've gone deep), then it can be possible
to think about going wide.
