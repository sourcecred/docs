# deep then wide

SourceCred is still a young project. As we grow it, we have a choice of priorities:

 - do we want to go "wide" (adoption by lots of projects) or
 - go "deep" (intensive usage by a few projects)?

#### What does it mean to go wide?

Going "wide" means encouraging lots of communities to start using SourceCred.
Since SourceCred can run on any GitHub repository or Discourse forum, we could
roll cred out to many different projects and groups. We could optimize for the
number of projects using SourceCred, and focus on features that make the scores
more salient or engaging — for example, making it easy to generate "weekly
reports" showing the new cred being earned by contributors.

Going wide is tempting because progress is very easy to measure, and the project
would get plenty of buzz which could bring more contributors and opportunities.

#### What does it mean to go deep?

Going deep means that instead of focusing on finding many projects that will
use SourceCred, we'll instead focus on making SourceCred work incredibly well
for a few communities. In part, this means paying a lot of attention to the edge
cases, and spots where SourceCred isn't working as intended, and trying to fix
those issues.

In many ways, going deep is more challenging than going wide. We could go wide
by marketing SourceCred and building buzz, but improving the core quality requires
a lot of experimentation with algorithms and community practices.

#### Going Deep First

We've decided to go deep before going wide. That means our priority is to prove
SourceCred can do a really great job at attributing cred with early-adopter
communities, before we try to scale for broader adoption.

We think that getting SourceCred to "really work" will require a lot of
experimentation and iteration. That's easier to do when there are only a few
communities using SourceCred, and those communities are all invested in working
with us to improve the system. Once we go wide, and have lots of adoption, it
will become harder to roll out meaningful changes to the system.

You can think of this as choosing to focus on quality before quantity. We want
to be sure that we can produce quality cred scores before putting them in front
of a larger audience.
