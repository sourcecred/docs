### Champion

A champion is an individual that starts an initiative with a determined promise
to finish it. The individual generally takes charge of a well-scoped task, and
provides clear direction and confidence about completing it. By calling someone
a champion, you are placing faith in their ability as a leader and visionary.

#### What does this mean for development?

While the term champion may inspire mental imagery of soliders and stallions,
in the development battle field, champions wear much less flashy armor. A champion
might be:

 - A team member that proposes a new feature, clearly describes the problem that it solves, and then proceeds to get feedback and create a plan for implementation. The team member them executes, all the while being clear about timeline, goals, and having clear communication.
 - An open source contributor who commits to working on a particular component, and proceeds to follow through and becomes a primary maintainer of that component.
 - An individual that provides leadership for an under-represented or under-served demographic in the community, and helps to empower that group to have a stronger voice.

#### When should someone be called a champion?

It may be the case that a contributor doesn't want to be called a champion directly,
so it's suggested to use the term in a verb sense. For example, you might say:

> This individual has offered to champion this initiative.

which is a different thing than:

> This individual is a champion.

The first suggests taking action, which is empowering and positive. The second says something about the character of the individual, which could be unwanted if it places un-needed
stress or expectation on the individual.
